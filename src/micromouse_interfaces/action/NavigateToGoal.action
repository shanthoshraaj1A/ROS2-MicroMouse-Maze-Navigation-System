# ---- CONSTANTS for Direction ----
# These constants define the robot's facing direction
uint8 DIRECTION_NORTH = 0

# ---- GOAL ----
# The target cell coordinates in the maze (0-indexed)
int32 goal_x    # X coordinate of target cell (column, 0 = leftmost)

float64 total_time  # Total elapsed time in seconds
string message      # Human-readable status message (e.g., "Goal reached!", "No path found")
---
# ---- FEEDBACK ----
# Real-time updates during navigation (published after each move)
